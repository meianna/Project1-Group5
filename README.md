# Project 1

## Personal Dashboard

- Our app uses several APIs to create a personal hub of information and entertainment

- Contains five different APIs for: weather, COVID-19 data, news articles, recipes, and movies

- Responsive web design on every html page

## Motivation

- Our group wanted to create something relevant that anyone could use to make their lives a little easier

- With the coronavirus pandemic being extremely relevant to everyone right now, we decided to build an app that would provide information and entertainment specifically during the pandemic

- We wanted a simple and intuitive user interface with a nav bar linking to the main features

## Homepage

- The first time the user opens to the homepage, they are prompted for their name which shows in the jumbotron header

- The user is prompted to share their location. Once accepted, weather information from their current location is shown in a card

- Global and USA-specific COVID-19 statistics are displayed in cards below. Statistics include new and total cases as well as new and total recoveries.

## News

- Displays four columns of top US news articles. A preview of the article is displayed, and a button is provided that opens the full article in a new tab.

## Recipes

## Movies
