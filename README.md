# Project 1

## Personal Dashboard

- Our app uses several APIs to create a personal hub of information and entertainment

- Contains five different APIs for: weather, COVID-19 data, news articles, recipes, and movies

- Responsive web design on every html page

## Motivation

- Our group wanted to create something relevant that anyone could use to make their lives a little easier

- With the coronavirus pandemic being extremely relevant to everyone right now, we decided to build an app that would provide information and entertainment specifically during the pandemic

- We wanted a simple and intuitive user interface with a nav bar linking to the main features

## Homepage

- The first time the user opens to the homepage, they are prompted for their name which shows in the jumbotron header

- The user is prompted to share their location. Once accepted, weather information from their current location is shown in a card

- Global and USA-specific COVID-19 statistics are displayed in cards below. Statistics include new and total cases as well as new and total recoveries

## News

- Displays four columns of top US news articles. A preview of the article is displayed, and a button is provided that opens the full article in a new tab

## Recipes

- The user may use the search bar to type in a dish they'd like a recipe for

- Search results are displayed in four columns. Clicking a recipe will append recipe info at the bottom of the page

- Click the crossed arrows button to generate a random recipe and show to screen

## Movies

- The user may click the button to generate a random movie from over 100 options

- The user is then presented with basic movie info, ratings info, a brief plot description, and an image of the movie poster

- Search history is prepended below the button and the user may click back on any movie previously generated
